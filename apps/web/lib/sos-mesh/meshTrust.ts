/**
 * Offline SOS Mesh — Server-side relay trust.
 *
 * A mesh only helps if a stranger's phone can carry your SOS out. That means
 * the gateway cannot authorise on the *relaying* session's identity — it has to
 * authorise on the packet itself.
 *
 * The rule here: any authenticated user may hand in a packet for any tourist,
 * provided the packet carries a valid BIP-340 signature from a key that tourist
 * has registered. Every routing field the authority queue acts on is then taken
 * from the signed event, never from the mutable JSON envelope, so a relay can
 * drop or delay a packet but never redirect or rewrite one.
